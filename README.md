Your task is to build a simple web application that displays daily returns or prices for one or more tickers over time. You may **use any modern front-end framework except Angular** (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, etc.). We expect that you will spend **approximately three hours** on the project. 

---

## Requirements

1. **Data Source**  
   - Use the attached CSV (`date, ticker, ret, price`) as your data source.  
   - You can load it from a local file in your web application.

2. **Ticker Selection**
   - A user should be able to input or select multiple ticker symbols to visualize in both of the following views.
   - The user should be able to **remove** a single ticker from the view or **clear** all tickers at once.

3. **Graph**
   - The user should be able to see a **graph** of either daily returns (`ret`) or daily prices (`price`) for the selected tickers over time.  

4. **Data Table**  
   - Provide a **table view** of the data that is being displayed.  
   - This can be a simple tabular layout showing date, ticker, return, and price for the filtered or selected tickers.

5. **Framework Constraints**  
   - You may use **any front-end framework** you prefer **except Angular**.  
   - Use whatever tooling that will help you quickly stand up your project.

6. **Time & Additional Features**  
   - Please spend **about three hours** on this project. Please include in your documentation the total time spent and an approximate breakdown of how you spent your time. 
   - Within that time, feel free to add **any features or design improvements** you believe would be useful or interesting (e.g., user-friendly controls, styling, data filtering, search functionality, etc.).

## Deliverables

1. **Project Code**  
   - All source code needed to run the project. **Please do not include `node_modules` or any dependencies in your zip. The final zip archive should be less than 1MB.**

2. **Brief Documentation**  
   - A short README detailing:
     - The framework and libraries used.
     - Any setup steps or commands required.
     - Any assumptions you made.
     - How to run your application (e.g., `npm install`, `npm start`, etc.).
   - If you added extra features or made specific technical decisions, please describe them briefly.
   - One to two paragraphs reviewing your own submission. Be as objective and quantitative as possible.

## What We Look For

- **Functionality**: Does the app allow input of multiple tickers, show the graph, allow removing/clearing tickers, and display a table as requested?
- **Code Organization & Readability**: Is the code structured logically with clear naming and well-organized components?
- **Technical Choices**: Are libraries and data handling approaches appropriate and well-reasoned?
- **User Experience**: Is the UI intuitive, and does it handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., no data, invalid ticker input, etc.)?
- **Extendibility**: Is the solution structured in a way that would allow additional features or modifications?
